# What is this?

This repo aims to declare the patterns of the Synaptic Standard, an alternative
to the [Dendritic Pattern](https://github.com/mightyiam/dendritic). The Synaptic Standard aims to solve many of the same
problems, but without a ton of boilerplate, or a
reliance on [`flake-parts`](https://github.com/hercules-ci/flake-parts).

# NOTE: work in progress

All of the documentation is still WIP, and much of it isn't written yet. I think what is here gives some good
fundamentals, but the goal is to build out the documentation over time, and merge parts in incrementally.

## demo

This provides a basic example of a configuration that follows a lot of the ideas
behind the Synaptic Standard. This is NOT an actual template - I've never tried
to boot it, and I doubt it would actually work. Instead, the point of this
section is to show one way these standards might be followed.

## standards

As you might guess by the name, this section goes into the actual STANDARDS that
I believe should be followed more often. Each standard first describes the
problems with the traditional way - and then goes into my chosen solutions.

## extra-standards

This section contains a few more "niche" standards. These might be a little more
complicated to explain, or lead to smaller improvements. If you really liked the
main standards and want some more, definitely check this out! If you're not that
interested, feel free to skip these.

## opinions

If you're only here to figure out why I don't like the Dendritic Pattern, this
section is for you. It goes into where and why I think the pattern misses the
mark.
