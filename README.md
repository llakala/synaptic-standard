# What is this?

This repo aims to declare the patterns of the Synaptic Standard, an alternative to the [Dendritic
Pattern](https://github.com/mightyiam/dendritic). The Synaptic Standard aims to solve many of the same problems, but
without a ton of boilerplate, or a reliance on [`flake-parts`](https://github.com/hercules-ci/flake-parts).

## Documentation (or lack thereof)

The documentation of this repo is still a work-in-progress on the [docs
branch](https://github.com/llakala/synaptic-standard/tree/docs). However, the demo attempts to be fairly
self-documenting, and should give you a good idea of what a configuration using the Synaptic Standard looks like.
